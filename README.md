## Disclaimer
The idea for this tool came after some guy sent curl requests to publicly-exposed Chromecasts on the internet to spread PewDiePie propaganda. As this is documented functionality you can't actually call this an exploit. Although one could wonder why this is possible without a single for of authentication.
